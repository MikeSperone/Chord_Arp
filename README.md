Android App - chord arpeggiating synthesizer

This is an arpeggiating synthesizer. It plays chords only. It is in a style I use a lot in my own music, a randomly arpeggiating series of notes, using those that are in the chord selected. You may choose what octave it begins on, and how many octaves the range should be.

This is the most basic version of it. More updates will be added soon. This will be released to the Android/Google Play store as a free app soon as I am comfortable with it being a well designed simple version. Further improvements, including more sounds, a better interface, more options, and possibly MIDI input and tempo sync, will be added into a paid version of the app.

These files included are only the source files, and need to be built in and IDE such as Android Studio or Eclipse.

If you use this app in your own performance, please let me know - and send some recordings or videos, I'd love to see this in use by other people.
